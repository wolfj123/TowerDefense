List of bonus features in our project:
- Drug tower (slowness)
- Goku tower (increasing damage over time)
- Dragon tower


Drug tower (slowness)
Extends the abstract class Tower (Visitor).
The visit methods of the Drug Tower call the inflictSlow method of the Creep (Visited).
The inflictSlow method behaves like the inflictPoison method regarding the duration calculation. 
A creep that has been slowed down, will have to wait more "ticks" until he performs a movement action.

________

Goku tower (slowness)
Extends the abstract class Tower (Visitor).
A private int field _h doubles each time the _numOfHits counter reaches 10.
The visit methods of the Goku Tower inflict damage by _h*k (k being the base damage for each different creep).

________

Dragon tower (slowness)
Extends the abstract class Tower (Visitor).
The tickAction method in this class overrides the super's and calculates a random direction to move to (change x,y).
